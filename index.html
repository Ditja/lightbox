                    <p>Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. Situated on the river Seine in the north
                        of the country, it is in the centre of the Île-de-France region, also known as the région
                        parisienne, "Paris Region". The City of Paris largely retains its one and a half century old
                        administrative boundaries, with an area of 105 km² (41 mi²) and as of 2014 a population of
                        2,241,346. </p>
                    <p>Together with its suburbs, the whole agglomeration has a population of 10,550,350 (Jan. 2012
                        census). Paris' metropolitan area spans most of the Île-de-France region and has a population of
                        12,341,418 (Jan. 2012 census), constituting one-fifth of the population of France. </p>

                    <p>Paris was founded in the 3rd century BC by a Celtic people called the Parisii, who gave the city
                        its name. By the 12th century, Paris was the largest city in the western world, a prosperous
                        trading centre, and the home of the University of Paris, one of the first in Europe.</p>
                    <p>In the 18th century, it was the centre stage for the French Revolution, and became an important
                        centre of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts, a position it still retains today.
                        Since the 19th century, the built-up area of Paris has grown far beyond its administrative
                        borders.</p>

                    <p>Paris is the home of the most visited art museum in the world, the Louvre, as well as the Musée
                        d'Orsay, noted for its collection of French Impressionist art, and the Musée National d'Art
                        Moderne, a museum of modern and contemporary art. </p>
                    <p>The notable architectural landmarks of Paris include Notre Dame Cathedral (12th century); the
                        Sainte-Chapelle (13th century); the Eiffel Tower (1889); and the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur on
                        Montmartre (1914). In 2014 Paris received 22.4 million visitors, making it one of the world's
                        top tourist destinations.[8] Paris is also known for its fashion, particularly the twice-yearly
                        Paris Fashion Week.</p>
